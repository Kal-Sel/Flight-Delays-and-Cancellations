# Flight Delays and Cancellations
## Project Description
In this project, I've created visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. I have created data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. My work should have been a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

There are 3 different data sets I could've choose from.
* Flight Delays and Cancellations
* US Census Demographic Data
* Youtube Data from the US

1) Flight Delays and Cancellations
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
The file I must have used in creating my data visualizations is the flights.csv file. The other two provided files can be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file, but should not be used alone.
I was required to create three visualizations. Some questions I may have attempted to answer included those pertaining to the following areas:

1. Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?
Determine which destinations and arrival destinations have the most delays? Doing this using maps is actually pretty difficult, but I was able to choose an alternative visual to provide this information. I had to think about what kind of aggregates might work best to determine which airlines and airports are the best and worst in terms of delays.

2. What causes delays?
Think about if I work at an airline and I want to decrease delays. What part of the flight causes the most delays? Do these causes vary by airport or time of year?

I could have also come up with my own question!

As I was working with the data, I came up with a question I was curious about and it could be answered from the data. I've build a dashboard to answer my question and lead viewers to that answer.
